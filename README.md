RBackend Engineering & Git – Simple Notes
Backend Engineering (Real Companies)
Backend engineers work on server-side logic, databases, APIs, authentication, and performance.
They ensure data is processed securely and correctly.
Backend vs Frontend vs DevOps
Frontend: UI and user experience.
Backend: Server logic, APIs, databases.
DevOps: Deployment, servers, automation.
How Teams Collaborate on Code
Teams use Git branches, commits, pull requests, and code reviews to work together safely.
Why Git Exists
Git tracks changes, prevents code loss, supports teamwork, and allows rollback to older versions.
Git Concepts
Repository
A storage location for project files and history.
Commit
A saved snapshot of changes.
Working Tree vs Staging Area
Working Tree: edit files.
Staging Area: prepare files for commit.
Local vs Remote Repository
Local: on your computer.
Remote: online for sharing and backup.
Common Git Commands
git init – create a repository
git status – check file status
git add – stage files
git commit – save changes
git config – set username and emailepository
A repository is a place where Git stores project files and their complete history. It can be local (on
your computer) or remote (on GitHub, GitLab, etc.).
Commit
A commit is a snapshot of your project at a specific time. It includes changes, author info, date, and
a message.
